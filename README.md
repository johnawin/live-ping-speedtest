# live-ping-speedtest
Minimal background app written in Flutter that will generate a live network speed test and return the results of ping and mbps as a silent notification on android. Ideally, the app should run in the background forever. Sending and receiving packets require very little resources and should have an unnoticeable impact on this generation's smart phones. The results will refresh at the rate of the users choice, allowing more control over the resources being used by the app.
